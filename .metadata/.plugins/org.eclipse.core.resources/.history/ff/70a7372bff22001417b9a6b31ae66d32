 *
 * Echos back each character received. Blinks green LED in main loop. Toggles
 * red LED on RX.
 *
 * Use /dev/ttyACM0 at 9600 Bauds (and 8,N,1).
 *
 * Note: RX-TX must be swaped when using the MSPg2553 with the Launchpad!
 *       You could easliy do so by crossing RX/TX on the jumpers of the
 *       Launchpad.
